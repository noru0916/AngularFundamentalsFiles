Angular Fundamentals Course
========================

The course is out of date. 

Everything is mostly up to date, but the course works with angular 1.2 but not 1.4. There are only a few areas where this matters. A course update should be published at any time.

Module 1, "Demo: Hello World in Angular" doesn't work.

In the module on routing, HTML5 routing requires a <base> tag. See this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base

You may have some difficulty in the testing module when following along the section on end to end testing.
